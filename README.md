## 🚀 A Quick Word on GitHub Actions

Hey there! 👋

So you’ve got your code on GitHub — nice! But what if I told you that your code could test, build, deploy, lint, format, and even tweet *while you sleep*? 😴💻

That’s where **GitHub Actions** comes in. Think of it as your project's personal assistant — always ready to run tasks for you whenever something happens, like a push, a PR, or even on a schedule.

With a simple YAML file, you can tell GitHub:

- 👷 "Run my tests on every push"
- 🧹 "Lint my code before merge"
- 🚢 "Deploy my app when I push to `main`"
- 🔁 "Run a weekly cleanup every Monday at 6 AM"

It lives in `.github/workflows/`, and you can mix and match pre-built actions from the marketplace or write your own.

In short: **GitHub Actions automates the boring stuff so you can focus on building awesome things**. 🔧✨

Wanna see it in action? Check out the [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) in this repo.

Happy automating! ⚙️🦾
